Introduction
------------

This project is a very simple network simulator that is designed mostly to practice
creating router algorithms.

Giovanni Greco
Contributions: 
Setup Github, shared screen during team work sessions, wrote code for first steps of 
Distance Vector including: initial data structures, Ping packet, routing Ping Packets. 
Did all of Link State
-----------------
Aden Mariyappa
Contributions:
General code review
Eventually scrapped progress towards Link State
Attempt at outputting the data collected during runtime
-----------------
Christian Cooper
Contributions:
Assisted group members in multiple tasks as well as implementing the algorithm that allows for calculating distances and storing the value
